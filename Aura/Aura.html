I got a bunch of homework to do and a lot of things just keep coming, I feel like I will never end up doing them. Therefore I made this website, these black dots represent my homework and stuffs, and they will keep showing until fulfilling this screen, you canâ€™t do anything but watch it coming. </div></span>
