  <div class="hi">  Hi, </div>
    <div class="name">Nice to meet you. This is Ruixue Cai. I’m a Chinese graphic designer currently studying at Virginia Commonwealth University. During my learning process, I aim to make things interactive and available to share feelings with people. Therefore, I designed my works to wake the familiar sensations and memories from people’s minds. The purpose of this personal website is to invite people to find colors in the colorless world. You can see from the design that this world I created is black and white, but after you (the user) entered, you could use the cursors to light some elements up. Although, It’s not entirely colorless. You can still find that my name and works have color, representing that the designer has brilliant ideas. Everything you can interactive with would have colors. It also describes the cooperation between designer and client.
Art is a way for me to express my feelings. I want to make people feel they are traveling through different worlds in my mind. My works combined my personal experiences with every emotional moment and inspiration. If my work could make you feel touched, I will call it a success. My goal in my future products is to make people think of others and understand them. I believe my designs will bring people together with more profound relationships.
Feel free to look around. You will see my other works on the “works” page.
