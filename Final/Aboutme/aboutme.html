  <div class="hi">  Hi, </div>
    <div class="name">Nice to meet you. This is Ruixue Cai. I’m a Chinese graphic designer studying at Virginia Commonwealth University. I aim to make things interactive and share feelings with people during my learning process. I designed my works to bring people different feelings and memories. For this website, the purpose is to tell people that this world used to be black and white, but after you (the user) and me (the designer) come, your idea and my works could bring it colors. For example, Only you (the cursor) and I (the name) have color on the home page, and as the cursor moves, some of the elements would be lighted up by the cursor.
 I want to make people feel they are traveling through different worlds in my mind. Art is not only a job for me; it is also a way for me to express my feelings. My works combined my personal experiences with every emotional moment and inspiration. If my work could make you feel touched, I will call it a success. My goal in my future products is to make people think of others and understand them. I believe that will bring people together with more profound relationships.
Feel free to look around. You will see my other works on the “works” page.
