<p class="b">Laurel Schwulst mentioned in her article that for now happiness and enjoyment are not the priorities of the big companies, instead that their websites are filled with advertisements. When I looked at her sentences, she said that the website could always be surprising and incomplete. I am beginning to built my own imaging website, I think the begging of this website could be a door, after open this door you will go to a new place, let’s imagine it would be the earth,after you click the earth it will bring you to another new place, but somewhere that related to earth. You’ll never know where the next place is, but somehow the next place is related to the last place. I hope people can enjoy themselves on this website, and discover it like a unknown deposit.
