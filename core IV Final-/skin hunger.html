<span class="special">Intro<div class="hidden">In this project, I aimed to find a new way to publish an article. I choose the article “skin hunger” of Mellisa Harris. In this website, I want people actually to feel the desire to touch skins. Therefore I translated this feeling into vision and interactive elements. I decide to use dialogue boxes to contain the conversations between Mellisa Harris and the artist Jamie diamond. The use of color in these dialogue boxes represent the color of their skins. The randomly displayed human body pictures would tremble as the cursor moves to them. As people scroll down and continue reading, the background color would change to red, representing the excited reactions people would make. To make the background more like a “skin,” I choose to make the title of this webpage as a tattoo. And the whole design of this project is aimed to simulate a comfortable, relaxed skin-touching interactive environment. </div></span>

    <div class="p">Where did you get the title for this project, Skin Hunger?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">This term has been mentioned in many different contexts, but typically I read about
      it through the lens of psychology—it is mainly used to describe the human ache for
      physical contact with another person. Even prior to the pandemic, loneliness was an
      epidemic. I think the COVID crisis just compounded a state of being that already
      existed. Obviously now we are all affected by aspects of this, regardless of our
      circumstances, and there are more severe ramifications to the current lack of
      physical contact and intimacy. I started this work pre-pandemic—my research began
      in 2015.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
    <div class="p">Is paid intimacy even intimacy? Are loneliness and lack of touch the same thing?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">You could also ask: is paid sex even sex? I guess I’m programmed to think that
      there’s a difference between authentic intimacy and performed intimacy, but in
      reality it’s not so clear. Intimacy is subjective and can be performed: it might be very
      real for the one it’s being performed for and not for the other, or both, or neither. In
      all the different industries and service economies I’ve been researching, intimacy
      manifests itself very differently—it’s very different within the Cuddle community
      than, for instance, the various rental opportunities available in Japan.
      Regarding loneliness being synonymous with lack of physical contact: they are not
      the same thing, but one is profoundly and fundamentally affected by the other
      whether we are conscious of it or not.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
    <div class="p">Let’s backtrack for a moment for context—how does this new project fit into the
      trajectory of your work?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2"> Early in my career, I made a series called Constructed Family Portraits where I
      solicited strangers—predominantly sourced from the Internet or through direct
      observation—to come and meet me in a rented hotel room and perform as a family.
      These people had no relationship with one another, yet they knew how to adapt and
      perform according to the specific paradigm of what a family looks like or appears to
      be, at least in this part of the world. I wanted to see how easy it would be to fake one
      of these icons, to recreate one of these idealized realities without any of the
      authenticity.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2"> Ten years later I learnt about family rental agencies in Japan. I spent several weeks
      in Tokyo interviewing some of the founding performers in order to learn more.
      These roles can last any-where from a few hours to several years, and while many
      of the rentals serve to satisfy specific Japanese social protocols, they often serve a
      simpler, more personal craving for intimacy. For example, there was one older
      woman who performed for years as a grandmother to an obviously fictional
      grandson. But to her fictional grandson, she was his very real grandmother.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
    <div class="p">Is something like this meant to create actual intimacy, or is it simply meant to fulfill
      some sort of social expectation in a way that makes everybody’s life easier?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2"> I think it varies. In some cases, I believe authentic intimacy and connection were
      experienced, while other times the service was used to fulfill an outwardly cultural
      or societal necessity like constructing the appearance of a whole and happy family.
      But there’s so much more to it than that, as I’m learning. What’s interesting to me is
      how the industry is growing. When I began my research in 2015, there were only a
      handful of rental agencies established. Now there are dozens, and there are all these
      other types of services you can rent out too: you can rent a middle-aged man, or
      hire someone to take selfies with you all around the city. You can hire a “handsome
      boy” to make you cry and wipe away your tears. You could hire someone to go
      shopping with you. It’s all become part of an active service economy.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2"> As platonic intimacy for hire now begins to find its place in the United States, it
      manifests itself in different ways; adapting to domestic cultural norms, with one of
      the main focuses being non-sexual physical intimacy and touch. This led me to the
      Cuddle community: professional Cuddlers who offer paying customers the
      opportunity to cuddle and experience non-sexual intimacy with a stranger.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
    <div class="p">the concepts of acceptable touch and of intimacy are elastic, but
      ground-ed in mutual consent and willingness?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2"> Right, and maybe cuddling is kind of a container or rather provides a context where
      you can test out and actually experience your own personal boundaries, not only
      theoretically, not just through communicating it, but through action. It’s actually
      more of a workshop, a “facilitated group experience” led by a certified facilitator. A
      cuddle party starts with a forty-five-minute explanation on consent: what consent
      means; what boundaries are; how to articulate your needs and wants; and what it
      means to comfortably receive and to give or to deny touch. It’s done in an incredibly
      sophisticated and authentic way.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
    <div class="p">You are generally a participant in the subjects you photograph. Did you participate
      in cuddling?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2"> Well, I really wanted to understand it and believe in it, and to do that I needed to
      experience it. I went to my first cuddle party and it was a really illuminating
      experience. I didn’t know what to expect going in. I entered an apartment, and there
      was an established cuddle room. On the floor there were blankets and pillows. It
      was a very warm and nurturing space. Communication and articulating your wants
      and needs is one of the first things you learn, as well as to ask before you do
      anything. All of this is presented as skills that are being taught. Another big thing is
      practicing saying “no”—something I’m not always very good at, as I want to please.
      Personally, I am working on saying what I want with confidence.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">I think many of us are conditioned to be a certain way for different reasons, so a lot
      of the cuddle party is about exploring those boundaries and communication skills by
      learning how to ask for what we want with clarity.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
    <div class="p">Is there a fine line between the platonic and the sexual in this environment?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">Yes—there can be. That’s why communication and establishing boundaries are so
      important.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="a">
    <div class="p">Is there an advocacy aspect? Is this about trying to help people function more
      authentically in their relationships? I’m just trying to wrap my head around this idea
      of outsourcing dynamics that feel fundamentally tied to intimate (by which I don’t
      necessarily mean sexual) human bonds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">I think there is an advocacy aspect. I know from talking extensively with Madelon
      that she co-founded Cuddlist in an attempt to cultivate more authentic relationships,
      and she does that by creating the conditions for that social dynamic to take form.
      Authentic connection is one of the core values taught during training. In response to
      your second question regarding helping people function more authentically in their
      own relationships, I absolutely think this is true.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">Research on touch shows that it has profound impacts: it releases endorphins and
      oxytocin which helps reduce stress and blood pressure; enables better sleep; and
      increases overall happiness and well-being. What is amazing is that these health
      benefits don’t require you to actually know the person. You don’t necessarily need
      an emotional relationship—it’s about the touch itself, which has enormous healing
      power. The skin is the body’s largest organ.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">Professional touch practitioners have told me that their clients talk very specifically
      about the effects touch has on them: that for weeks after the session it still fulfills
      them; it satisfies them and makes them happier; they’re more efficient within the
      workplace. It affects their relationships, friendships. There is a fundamental shift in
      their behavior.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">There are also very real effects of being touch-deprived: it can lead to depression
      and anxiety and a myriad of other health issues. Even during the COVID crisis, when
      the practitioners were working virtually, using techniques like self-touch, eye gazing,
      virtual cuddling, mirror exercises—it’s not the same as physical Cuddling of course,
      but it was still beneficial. My first experience of a virtual session elicited such
      unexpected feelings. There was something very poignant and very moving about the experience of even touching an
      inanimate object; hearing the practitioner’s
      voice; hearing someone narrate the experience of touch. During eye gazing, it felt so
      strange to be looked at so deeply for so long through a screen. I felt a connection
      despite the fact that we were miles and miles apart. There was something that felt
      very real—maybe it was because of the one-to-one ratio, and our physical proximity
      to the cameras on our computers.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="b">
    <div class="p2">
      So many people are deprived of touch and connection, and even though this is
      outsourced it is satisfying that need. In some ways this may signal our future, or at
      least an evolution in our understanding of certain aspects of physical intimacy and
      personal contact. I have been reading recently about a fascinating and uncanny new
      AI social robot meant for children called Moxie. It’s meant to be a social companion
      and an educator who fulfills the need for connection and emotional learning.
